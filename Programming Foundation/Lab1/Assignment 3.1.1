1. Algorithm is finding the smallest and the largest element of the array and storing it in x and y respectively and
 returning the difference between them.

2. In the algorithm x and y stores the element at the 0th position of the array as the initial condition for n-2 
   iterations element stored in x is compared with it similarly element stored in y is compared with the elements 
   of the array for n-2 iterations, the largest element is stored in y for every comparison made between the basic 
   operation is executes n-1 times. It dependes on the size of the array given as input by user.
   
   
 suppose n=7 and A[7]=[10 12 1 5 15 6]
 then,
 
 i  A[i]  x     y
 1   10   10    10
 2   12   10    12
 3    1    1    12
 4    5    1    12
 5   15    1    15
 6    6    1    15
