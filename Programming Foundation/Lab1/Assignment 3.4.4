 The algorithm is computing the sum of the n elements starting from 1 to the n which is taken as input.
  
 efficiency class of the algorithm is O(n)
 as per the formula:
 i=1 to u summation of(1=u-l+1)
 where i is initial condition of the loop and l is final condition.
 hence,
 i=1 to n summation of(1=u-l+1)
 hence we get,
 i=1 to n summation of (l=n)
 therefore efficiency of algorithm is O(n).
